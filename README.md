# ROCKPAPERSCISSORSGAME

This project is my partipation of the assignment from the odin project.

The application goal is to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with only javascript. Therefore, this project don't contain any interactive visual interface since no HTML or CSS is used.

Input and output is generated to the user using prompt and console.log only. 

This application features :

- Each game is 5 round 
- Input from the user is taken from the prompt value that is programmed to include only the rock paper or scissors string.
- You play against the computer that generates a choice randomly between rock paper or scissors.
- Each round an output informs you if you won, lost and if it's a tie by displaying you and the computer picks
- After the end of all 5 rounds final score is declared
